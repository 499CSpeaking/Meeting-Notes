# Topics for Week 5 Meeting

## research
We identified these projects/methods for animating a still image to lip-sync an audio file.

**note: as speed is a general requirement, we should attempt to determine the relative amount of time these projects/approaches should take to convert a still image to a speaking image.**

### projects
1. Wav2Lip. https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip. The result itself looks good. Image moves around very little so good compression. biggest issue is that the project cannot be used for commercial purpose by default. **We can request commercial use of the project. See project's README.**

2. LipGAN. https://github.com/Rudrabha/LipGAN. Looks very similar to Wav2Lip. License is miles more lax than Wav2Lip's.
