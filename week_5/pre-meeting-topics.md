# Topics for Week 5 Meeting

## research
Multiple approaches to animating a face exist within the SpeakingPortal repo. We will have 15 minutes to discuss these approaches with the client during the meeting

## specification
I believe we need to clarify some ambiguity since last meeting, our specification needs to be more specific.
- file format of the output video
- target audience
- is there a "limit" to how long a say, 30 second clip should take to generate?
