## specifications
- The input audio file will be of the wav format.
- According to Erik, it doesn't matter what format we output the video file in. However, they are currently using mov and mp4 formats.

## research approaches
Nazim prefers that we use the faster and more realistic (in terms of goals or appearance?) method. Other than that, Nazim has no personal (non-technical) preferences.

## tech stack
they would prefer it to be javascript so that it works better with their API, but this is not a requirement.

# for next week
Before next week's meeting, we should choose which approach we use. We also need to decide on some in-depth requirements relating to the specific approach we use.
