# week 6 meeting notes

## database
The database will be persistent and avatars stored within the database will not be deleted on a known schedule

## default avatars
We can store Kukarella's default avatars either within our own database or we can query Kukarella's systems for them.

# next week
Nazim wants all three groups to decide on resources we need as well as our preferred milestones and send them together.
